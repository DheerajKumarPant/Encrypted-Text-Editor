# EncryptedTextEditor
This application was created to encrypt text using a password. This project is built in JAVA. A Key is entered by user then it converted into 4 keys. These 4 keys are used in encryption. "KeyGenerator" class is used to create keys. To encrypt first all text is read character by character and xored with keys. "Encryption and Decryption" class is used. There is a round 2 to encrypt text. In round 2 AES algorithm is used. There is a predefined function in JAVA to do so. After that encrypted text is saved in a file with extension '.vc'. Headers and Footers are used to recognize an encrypted file. Encrypted text file is read only. If file is modified then it can not be decrypted.
